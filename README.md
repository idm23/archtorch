# ArchTorch

ArchTorch is a tool for building and training Deep Learning Models. It was inspired by frustrations I encountered constructing models with multiple loss functions and outputs. ArchTorch utilises directed acyclic graphs under the hood to build your model whatever way you see fit, while keeping the training process simple via organized namespaces implemented through dictionaries.

## Installation

TODO:

First install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) yourself. I'd love to put this in the setup.py but it seems to be a common problem enough that I'm not willing to solve it personally. 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.
  
```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

TODO:

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
